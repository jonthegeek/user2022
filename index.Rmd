## Assistive Technology

Assistive Technology is any form of technology (software, device) that helps people with disabilities perform certain activities. 

Examples:

- walking sticks
- wheel chairs
- screen readers

## Screen reader


A screen reader is an assistive technology that supports blind or visually impaired people in using their computer.

## Accessibility as Career Preparation

[Accessible Technology Skills Gap Report  by The Partnership on Employment & Accessible Technology (PEAT), 2018](https://www.peatworks.org/infographic-the-accessible-technology-skills-gap/)

84% of industry respondents say it is important or very important to their company to hire developers and designers with accessible technology skills.


60% said it was difficult or very difficult for their organization to find job candidates with accessibility skills. 0% said it was easy or very easy.

41% of companies consider accessibility certification credentials as a differentiator in hiring.

## Curriculum Goal

As educators, we have to ensure that the current and the next generation of data scientists, provide public-facing outputs (websites, analysis reports, etc.) that are accessible.


---

class: middle

## Learning Objectives

- Students should get familiar with American Disabilities Act. 
- Students should use at least one assistive technology (i.e. screen reader).
- Students should consider different representations of data.

---



class: middle

Students can use screen reader on Windows and Mac

- If you are on a Windows machine go to Settings > Ease of Access > Narrator, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.

- If you are on a Mac go to System Preferences > Accessibility > Voice Over > Enable Voice Over

## Data Verbalization

### Alternate Text

- "Alt text" describes contents of an image. 
- It is used in HTML pages. 
- Screen-readers cannot read images but can read alt text. 
- Alt text has to be provided. 
- We can verbalize data via alternate text.

## (some) Chunk Options in R Markdown

<table align = "center">



<tr>

<td>warning = FALSE</td>
<td>hides warning</td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td>fig.cap = "Some figure caption"</td>
<td>creates a figure caption</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>fig.align = "center"</td>
<td>centers the figure in the page</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>fig.alt = "Some alternate text for figure"</td>
<td>creates alternate text for figures</td>

</tr>

### Manual Alternate Text

- Chart type

- Type of data

- Reason for including the chart

- Link to data or source (not in alt text but in main text)

### Data Verbalization -  Automated

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  mutate(transmission = if_else(am == 0, "automatic", "manual"))
```


```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=4}
example_barplot <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = transmission)) +
  geom_bar()
example_barplot
```

The automated alternate text for this plot is on the next slide.

class: middle

### Data Verbalization -  Automated


```{r echo=TRUE}
BrailleR::VI(example_barplot)
```

<hr>

Drawback of using `VI()` is that not every type of plot can be verbalized yet.

### Alternate Texts are Under Utilized in the Data Science Community

"Over the 3 years of TidyTuesday, there were 7,136 data viz tweets and only 215 (3%) of them had alt-text"

## Data Sonification

Data sonification is the presentation of data as sound. 

Examples:

Accessibility features should not be accidental. 

---

class: middle rec

Disclosure should fall on event (including meetups) organizers.

---

class: middle rec

Accessibility should not fall on volunteers.   
In communities where work is solely based on volunteers then volunteer(s) for accessibility should be considered.

---

class: middle rec

Accessibility should be taught at undergraduate, graduate, and equivalent practitioner trainings.


---

class: middle rec

Accessibility can be taught as part of language specific (e.g. R) and language agnostic trainings.

---

class: middle rec

Accessibility should be taught in a way that learners can apply their learning in non-data contexts.

---

class: middle rec

Students should be assessed on and held accountable for their accessibility practices.

Accessibility is for everyone.
