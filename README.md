# Teaching Accessibly and Teaching Accessibility

World Health Organization estimates that over one billion people - about 15% of the global population- experience a disability. As R educators, whether we teach in a classroom, at a meetup, or on social media, we need to ensure that our teaching is accessible to all learners. There is a close link between what gets taught and what gets practiced. Thus, not only should we be teaching accessibly but we should also be teaching about accessibility to learners. The inclusion of accessibility in the curricula can enable current and future R educators and developers to utilize accessibility recommendations in their teaching and R products. In this talk, I will share examples from statistics and data science classes where my collaborators and I started incorporating accessibility practices into our teaching. In addition, I will share a selection of R examples that I use to teach accessibility to my students.
